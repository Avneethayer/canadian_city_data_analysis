Footnotes:
1,"The crime severity index is calculated using Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data. Incident-based UCR2 data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents."
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services."
3,"The methodology for calculating census metropolitan area (CMA) populations was modified in 2003. Starting in 1996, the populations for CMAs have been adjusted to reflect the actual policing boundaries within the CMA and do not reflect the official Statistics Canada population for these CMAs. CMA data are included within province-level data."
4,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident."
5,"In January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes that consider the complexities of certain offences such as sexual assault, family violence and intimate partner violence. Under the new reporting standards, specific offences may be more likely reported by police as founded rather than unfounded (or unsubstantiated), which would exclude them from police-reported crime rates and crime severity indices. Data for 2019 represent the first complete year of UCR data collected under the new reporting standards.  As a result, for selected violations and police services, the actual proportion of incidents in 2019 that were classified as “not cleared” has increased. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years."
6,"A high crime rate or Crime Severity Index (CSI) may indicate that a municipality is a geographical area that provides commercial business, human or public services, or entertainment for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, these municipalities may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate and CSI calculations."
7,"It is important to note that while official police-reported data on crime from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey use Statistics Canada's standard Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) names, the boundaries for the policing-based CMAs do not always fully align with the standard CMA geographic units used for disseminating information about the Census of Population."
8,"Police service Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) and respondent populations are created using the July 1 Census subdivision (CSD) population estimates prepared by the Centre for Demography at Statistics Canada. Variations might exist between the CSD estimates for Alberta used for the period from 2016 to 2020 and those produced by the Alberta Office of Statistics and Information."
9,"The Crime Severity Index (CSI) is an area-based measure that summarizes police-reported crime in an area as an index value. The CSI was developed to complement the conventional crime rate and other indicators by considering both the number and severity of crimes in a given area. The CSI is not an indicator of overall safety and should be interpreted in the broader community context. For more information, see “Understanding and using the Crime Severity Index” on Statistics Canada’s Crime and Justice subject hub."
10,"With the release of 2012 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2004. This resulted in boundary changes for the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Saint John for 2005 to 2011 and for Winnipeg for 2011. Crime data for these years for these respondents have therefore been revised."
11,"The crime severity index includes all Criminal Code violations including traffic, as well as drug violations and all Federal Statutes."
12,"The Crime Severity Index (CSI) measures changes in the level of severity of crime in Canada from year to year. In the index, all crimes are assigned a weight based on their seriousness. The level of seriousness is based on actual sentences handed down by the courts in all provinces and territories. More serious crimes are assigned higher weights, less serious offences lower weights. As a result, more serious offences have a greater impact on changes in the index. The PRCSI is standardized to 100 in base year 2006. CSI weights are updated using data from the Integrated Criminal Courts Survey (ICCS) every 5 years. 2022 marks the third update to the CSI weights since 1998. 2021 revised and 2022 CSI data are presented here using the updated weights and may have a marginal impact on the CSI data itself."
13,"The Crime Severity Index is not available for police services or detachments with populations less than 1,000. Data for police services or detachments with populations less than 5,000 should be used with caution."
14,"Population figures reflect only the permanent or resident population of a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction serves as the centre for commercial businesses, human or public services, or entertainment, it may have substantial “part-time” populations, e.g., tourists, cabin owners, commuters, students, and seasonal staff. These temporary populations, whose permanent residence is within another jurisdiction, are excluded from a jurisdiction’s population figures. This may be a factor to consider when examining the crime rate and Crime Severity Index for some municipalities."
15,"This represents the year-over-year (current year over last year) percentage change."
16,"The violent crime severity index includes all Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) violent violations, some of which were not previously included in the aggregate violent crime category, including uttering threats, criminal harassment and forcible confinement."
17,"The non-violent crime severity index includes all non-violent Criminal Code violations including traffic, as well as drug violations and all Federal Statutes."
18,"The Youth Crime Severity Index is based on the same principles as the Overall Crime Severity Index, which reflects the relative seriousness of different offences, but uses the number of youths accused instead of an incident count."
19,"There is no youth crime severity index data available for census metropolitan areas (CMAs)."
20,"This represents the year-over-year (current year over last year) percentage change."
21,"The youth violent crime severity index includes all Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) violent violations, some of which were not previously included in the aggregate violent crime category, including uttering threats, criminal harassment and forcible confinement."
22,"The youth non-violent crime severity index includes all non-violent Criminal Code violations including traffic, as well as drug violations and all Federal Statutes."
23,"The weighted clearance rate is based on the same principles as the Police Reported Crime Severity Index (CSI), whereby more serious offences are assigned a higher "weight" than less serious offences. For example, the clearing of homicides, robberies or break and enters would represent a greater contribution to the overall weighted clearance rate value than the clearing of minor theft, mischief or disturbing the peace."
24,"In 2012, it was discovered that the Montreal Police Service had been incorrectly applying the agreed upon definition for reporting child pornography incidents to the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2). As such, the number of violations has been revised for the years 2008 to 2011."
25,"Part of the 2007 increase in crime in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saint John, New Brunswick can be attributed to changes in police reporting practices rather than actual increases in criminal activity."
26,"Abbotsford-Mission, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario became new census metropolitan areas (CMAs) as of the 2001 Census. Moncton, New Brunswick, Peterborough, Ontario, Brantford, Ontario, Guelph, Ontario, Barrie, Ontario, and Kelowna, British Columbia became new CMAs as of the 2006 Census. Lethbridge, Alberta and Belleville, Ontario became new CMAs as of the 2016 Census. Fredericton, New Brunswick; Drummondville, Quebec; Red Deer, Alberta; Kamloops, British Columbia; Chilliwack, British Columbia and Nanaimo, British Columbia became new CMAs as of the 2021 Census."
27,"Part way through 2013, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police revised policing boundaries for rural detachments in New Brunswick. This resulted in a change in the census metropolitan area (CMA) boundaries that are determined for the purpose of reporting crime statistics. As such, 2013 data for the New Brunswick CMAs of Saint John and Moncton are not comparable to previous or future years. Further, data from 2014 onward are not comparable to years prior to 2014."
28,"In 2018, Saint John Municipal Police Service identified a data processing issue that affected certain violations including: sexual assault (1310, 1320, 1330), assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm (1420), failure to appear (3510), failure to comply with order (3410) and breach of probation (3520). As such, estimations were applied for 2016 and 2017. Data should therefore be used with caution."
29,"Due to unforeseen circumstances, Saint John Police Service was unable to submit Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey data for November and December 2020 and as such estimates at the violation level were produced. Estimates were created using available data for Saint John in 2019 along with their 2020 data submissions from April to October to take into account any differences related to the COVID-19 pandemic."
30,"In 2016, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment in Montréal underwent an exercise in making corrective measures to address under-counting of incidents importation/exportation and trafficking of drug offences. In response, Statistics Canada applied estimates to the 2015 revised data. As a result, numbers and rates from 2015 onwards should not be compared to data prior to 2015."
31,"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Saguenay was formerly known as Chicoutimi-Jonquière."
32,"With the release of 2013 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2011. This resulted in boundary changes for the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Saguenay. Crime data for these years for this respondent have therefore been revised."
33,"The 2009 Sherbrooke clearance rate is exceptionally high because of dedicated efforts throughout the year to update the database before a major conversion in informatics."
34,"Data for Sherbrooke were not available in 2010, and therefore have been copied over from 2009 at the request of the police service."
35,"Clearance data for Montreal were not available in 2010, and therefore have been estimated based on clearance information from previous years."
36,"In 2020, the Montréal census metropolitan area (CMA) in Quebec accounted for the majority of the national decrease in importation or exportation offences reported under the Cannabis Act, decreasing 72% (4,180 fewer incidents) from 2019 to 2020. The large decrease in offences year-over-year was due in part to fewer postal seizures and seizures conducted by the Canada Border Services Agency in Montréal since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic."
37,"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Ottawa-Gatineau was formerly known as Ottawa-Hull."
38,"During the revision of 2001 data for the province of Ontario, a discrepancy in methodology applied by the forces in the province using the Ontario Municipal and Provincial Police Automated Co-operative (OMPPAC) system was detected. These forces report approximately one-third of the total criminal incidents for the province and include the Ontario Provincial Police and about 60 small and mid-sized municipal forces. This discrepancy resulted in an over-count of less serious criminal incidents. During 2003 and 2004, the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS) consulted with affected police services and analyzed both historical Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) data and more recent Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) microdata to determine the impact of this over-reporting. The effect at the Canada level was, on average, 1% per year from 1977 to 2000. This over-counting peaked in 1991, where it was estimated that the total crime rate for the country was over-estimated by approximately 1.8%. However, the overall historical trend changed very little. The impact in Ontario is more noticeable, but the overall trend is still very similar. On average, the effect was 2% to 3% per year, with the biggest change occurring in 1991, where the Ontario crime rate is 5% lower as a result of the adjustment. For further information, refer to the report: <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/document/3302_D13_T9_V1-eng.pdf">Summary of Historical Adjustments to Crime Data for Ontario 1977-2000</a>."
39,"Data for 2024 from Kingston Police may be undercounted due to a cyber-attack that was experienced in November and December 2024."
40,"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Belleville-Quinte West was formerly known as Belleville."
41,"In 2009, slight changes were made to the respondent-to-CMA mapping for this census metropolitan area (CMA) which have resulted in minor revisions to previously published data."
42,"Crime data from September to December 2024 for Brantford are estimates (except for homicides) due to delays in recording and validating incidents in their records management system. Use with caution when comparing these data with prior years."
43,"Crime data from April to December 2004 for Winnipeg are estimates (except for homicide and motor vehicle theft) due to the implementation of a new records management system. Use with caution when comparing these data with prior years."
44,"Approximately half of the vehicle thefts in Winnipeg in 2007 were attempts, higher than the national average of about 15%. Both the decrease in the number of completed vehicle thefts in Winnipeg, as well as the increase in attempted thefts, may be attributed to the new provincial requirement for specific high-risk vehicles to be equipped with immobilizers, rendering these vehicles much more difficult to steal."
45,"Prior to 1999, a number of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachments in Saskatchewan were double counting the number of actual offences of impaired driving. This over-counting was corrected in 1999, therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution. It is recommended that the analysis of impaired driving be based on persons charged data rather than actual offences."
46,"The decrease in the Crime Severity Index (CSI) in Saskatchewan is partly attributable to a change in the classification of some incidents involving alcohol consumption on a dry reserve. These incidents were previously reported by some police services as violations under the Indian Act and included in “other federal statues” (6900). In 2017, due to information from the Federal Prosecutors Indigenous community by-law infractions will no longer be prosecuted under the Indian Act, these detachments began reporting these types of offences as mischief (2170) or disturbing the peace (3430) under the Criminal Code, which have a lower weight in the CSI than federal statute offences."
47,"Youth crime in British Columbia may be somewhat undercounted due to the Crown charge-approval system in place whereby, even for minor offences, there must be approval by the Crown before charges are laid after police have made an arrest. This approval is based on the substantial likelihood of conviction."
48,"Part of the overall increase in police-reported crime in British Columbia and some of its census metropolitan areas in 2019 may be attributed to the implementation of new reporting standards for classifying incidents. More specifically, in January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes. While the effective date for the change was January 2018 and many police services adopted the new standards that year, some police services, including all of the RCMP detachments across Canada and the municipal police services in British Columbia, transitioned to the new standards on January 1, 2019. Additionally, police services in British Columbia undertook a uniform training strategy to further standardize reporting throughout the province. The new reporting standards were expected to result in an increase in crime rates over time."
49,"In Kelowna in 2019, a national Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sexual Assault Review Team undertook a review of current and historical sexual assault cases in the RCMP detachment in Kelowna to ensure appropriate use of the reporting standards for classifying incidents as founded or unfounded. As a result, Kelowna’s 2018 statistics for sexual assault have been revised from the original counts released in July 2019. As well, the file review and adoption of the new incident clearance codes have likely contributed to a notably higher number of sexual assault incidents when compared to previous years."
50,"Data for 2001 include estimates for 3 months for the Vancouver police service and 2 months for the Port Moody police service, covering the phase-in period required for a new records management system. In addition, from September 2000 to September 2001, as a result of labour action, there were decreases in the number of crimes reported to the Vancouver police service for certain offences. As a result, the number of Criminal Code offences reported by Vancouver were affected during this period."
51,"As a result of ongoing investigations in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, there were 5 homicides reported in the Vancouver census metropolitan area (CMA) total for 2007, 5 reported in 2004, 7 reported in 2003 and 15 included in 2002 that occurred in previous years. Homicides are counted according to the year in which police file the report."
52,"In 2004, Vancouver police service changed their scoring procedures for reporting impaired driving incidents to include all incidents of impaired driving, not just those resulting in a charge being laid, meaning that incidents cleared by other means, (for example, roadside suspension) are now included. This resulted in almost 1,900 additional incidents being reported in 2004 compared to 2003. Use with caution when comparing these data with prior years."
53,"Between April 1 and September 30 2014, the British Columbia Integrated Child Exploitation Unit (BC ICE) undertook a proactive project to record Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in possession of, and possibly sharing child pornography. This resulted in an increase in reported child pornography violations that year and all incidents detected by the BC ICE unit were recorded in the records management system used by Surrey Police Service. Therefore, while the incidents were reported through Surrey and appear in crime statistics for Surrey (and the Vancouver census metropolitan area [CMA] as Surrey is within this CMA's boundaries), neither the incidents themselves nor the offenders are limited to Surrey."
54,"The increase in incidents of child pornography between 2015 and 2016 in Vancouver can be in part attributed to a proactive project initiated by the British Columbia Integrated Child Exploitation Unit which recorded Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that were in possession of, and possibly sharing child pornography. As the initiative focused on Vancouver in 2016, notable increases in these offences were reported by this jurisdiction. As a result, comparison with previous years should be done with caution."
55,"In 2020, the Vancouver census metropolitan area (CMA) in British Columbia accounted for 56% of all importation or exportation offences reported under the Cannabis Act (4,194 of the 7,552 offences reported nationally). The high proportion of offences was due in part to seizure cases, conducted by the Canada Border Services Agency and the Canada Post Mail Centre in the Vancouver CMA, being forwarded for processing and investigation to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). As a result of this exchange, the year in which occurrences were reported by the RCMP may not always correspond to the year in which they occurred."
56,"The increase in incidents of child pornography between 2014 and 2015 can be in part attributed to a proactive project initiated by the British Columbia Integrated Child Exploitation Unit which recorded Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that were in possession of, and possibly sharing child pornography. As the initiative focused on Victoria in 2015, notable increases in these offences were reported by this jurisdiction."
57,"1998 data in this table for Northwest Territories also includes Nunavut. In 1999, Nunavut, which comprises the eastern part of the old Northwest Territories, officially became a Canadian territory. Starting in 1999, data are displayed separately for the Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
